Here’s a short “reading roadmap” that will walk you from “Hello LangGraph” to more advanced, multi-node agents—all in Python. The bullets are ordered so you can progress top-to-bottom.

| Where to look                                                           | What you’ll learn                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guides → Get started → Quickstart** (official docs)                   | The canonical one-pager: install LangGraph, spin up a _create_react_agent_ example, add memory, and stream results. It’s the fastest way to confirm that your local set-up works. ([LangChain][1])                                             |
| **Guides → Get started → LangGraph basics** (overview page)             | Six bite-sized tutorials that build a support chatbot step-by-step—adding tools, memory, human-in-the-loop approvals, custom state, and “time-travel” debugging. Great for seeing how each concept maps onto code. ([LangChain][2])            |
| **Build a basic chatbot** (first lesson in the basics series)           | Walks through creating a `StateGraph`, defining nodes, compiling, and visualising the graph—perfect for understanding LangGraph’s state-machine core before adding loops or branches. ([LangChain][3])                                         |
| **Platform quickstart → Local server**                                  | How to use the `langgraph` CLI to scaffold a project, launch the dev API, and open LangGraph Studio for visual, time-travel debugging—all running locally (no cloud keys required). ([LangChain][4])                                           |
| **Real Python article “LangGraph: Build Stateful AI Agents in Python”** | A longer, narrative tutorial (intermediate level) that shows how to build a state-graph agent, add conditional edges, and write tests. Ideal once you grasp the basics and want to see larger-scale, production-style code. ([Real Python][5]) |
| **DataCamp “What Is LangGraph and How to Use It?”**                     | Provides a conceptual overview (fault-tolerance, multi-agent orchestration) plus installation and starter snippets—handy if you like slide-style explanations alongside code. ([DataCamp][6])                                                  |

### How to navigate

1. Open the LangGraph documentation at **docs.langgraph.ai** (or `langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph`).
2. In the left sidebar, expand **Guides › Get started** to access **Quickstart** and **LangGraph basics**.
3. Inside **LangGraph basics**, follow the numbered tutorials, starting with **Build a basic chatbot**.
4. When you’re ready for GUI debugging, head to **Guides › LangGraph Platform › Quickstart** for the dev-server instructions.

This sequence will take you from a single-file demo to a full, inspectable graph running on your WSL2 stack. Happy exploring!
