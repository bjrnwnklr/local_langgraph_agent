# LangGraph

Local LangGraph playground

    This outline was generated by ChatGPT and then adjusted (ChatGPT used outdated / deprecated versions of LangGraph).

    Observations:

    -   The OLLama local LLM works but is very slow (even using Mistral, which is a relatively small model)
    -   The vectorDB is not really used anywhere in the example and would have to be added for meaningful use
    -   It's likely better to just follow the quickstart tutorials from LangGraph and learn from the ground up
